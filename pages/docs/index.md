# Integration. Made. Simple.

At Pay.com, we make taking payments as simple as possible for all businesses, regardless of their size.

You can easily integrate our online payment solutions into your website or app, or choose our no-code solutions which donâ€™t require any integration efforts.

If you want to start taking payments right away, take a look at our no-code solutions in the [Dashboard Payments](https://pay.com/docs/no-code-payments/portal-payment) section of the guide.

Our [Pay Checkout](https://pay.com/docs/checkout/overview-checkout) solutions are a low-code approach to taking payments securely on your website or app. You can add a fully customizable pre-built checkout page to your website or embed our hosted Pay Components into a pre-existing checkout page.  

> Whichever solution you choose, you benefit from our Level 1 PCI DSS compliance.
